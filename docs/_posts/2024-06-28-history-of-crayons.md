## Early Beginnings

The term crayon originated from the Latin word 'creta,' which means earth. The first crayons are believed to have been made with mixed charcoal and oil in ancient Egypt. Similarly, Greeks and Romans used waxed tablets with styluses made from metal or bone to record transactions and write letters. 

During the Renaissance, great artists like Leonardo da Vinci used chalk and various pigments to create their preliminary drawings.

## Rise of the Modern Crayon

The journey towards the modern crayon started in the 19th century. At this time, companies like Staedtler in Germany and Joseph Lemercier in France started producing crayons. But it was France that produced the first modern colored crayon—a mixture of pigmented powder and a more stable oil-based substance. 

However, the initial products were not suitable for children because of their high price and fragility.

## The Binney & Smith Era

In 1903, Binney & Smith, an American company known for producing industrial colorants, launched a new product—Crayola crayons. The word 'Crayola' was coined by Alice Binney, wife of the company's co-founder, combining two French words: craie, which means chalk, and ola, for oily. 

Crayola's inaugural box, which contained eight crayons: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and black, was sold for a nickel and was the first set of affordable colored crayons made specifically for children.

## The 20th Century and Beyond

The 20th century saw the expansion of the crayon industry with competition increasing and companies striving to differentiate their products. For instance, Crayola introduced the 'No. 64' in 1958, a box with a built-in sharpener and 64 different colors.

Crayons were sent to the moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 as a symbol of peace and childhood. The advent of the digital era and new technologies like 3D printing have also revolutionized the use of crayons. 

## Environmental Impacts & Initiatives

With growing concerns about the environment, many crayon companies have started to adopt environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and materials. Crayola, for example, launched an initiative called 'ColorCycle' in 2013, encouraging schools to collect spent markers for recycling and energy recovery. The art company also committed to power their plant with 100% renewable energy.
