## Definition and Context
Euthanasia refers to the act of intentionally causing the death of a patient, typically to relieve them from insufferable pain or incurable illness. The term comes from the Greek words "eu", meaning good," and "thanatos", signifying death. Thus, euthanasia is often called "mercy-killing". It aligns closely with the concept of 'end of life decisions', an important aspect of medical ethics that involves making choices regarding life-sustaining treatment or planning in advance for medical treatment in the event the patient loses the ability to make decisions.

## Types of Euthanasia
Euthanasia is generally categorized into four types:

1. *Voluntary Euthanasia*: The patient's life is terminated upon their specific request, usually in cases of extreme suffering or terminal illness.
2. *Non-voluntary Euthanasia*: Life is ended without the express consent of the patient, typically when the patient is unconscious or unable to communicate.
3. *Involuntary Euthanasia*: Life termination happens against the patient's wishes, which is generally considered murder and is illegal globally.
4. *Physician-assisted Suicide*: The physician provides the means or information for the patient to end his or her own life but does not directly administer the lethal dose.

## Bioethical Debates on Euthanasia
The debate over euthanasia stirs intense emotion, pitting assertions of individual autonomy against deep-rooted beliefs in the sanctity of life. 

The proponents of euthanasia argue for the respect for autonomy—people should have freedom over their body and life—and relief from suffering. They assert that just as patients have the right to refuse treatment, they should have the power to choose death to end unbearable suffering.

Opponents, however, consider life to be sacred and inviolable. They argue the role of doctors is to preserve life, not to take it, and express concern over potential abuse and the devaluation of life. They also point to cases where patients have been misdiagnosed, and so may opt for euthanasia based on incorrect medical advice.

## International Laws and Perspective
Legislation on euthanasia varies globally, reflecting national, cultural, and religious values. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Colombia, and some U.S. states like Oregon and California, have legalized some form of euthanasia. However, most countries, including the UK, maintain strict laws against it, classifying it as murder or manslaughter.

## Case Studies
Two famous cases exemplify the ethical nuances in end of life decisions:

1. *Diane Pretty Case* - Diane Pretty, a UK citizen with motor neurone disease, was denied her request to have her husband help her die, under UK law. The European Court of Human Rights supported the judgement, and Pretty died naturally.
  
2. *Terri Schiavo case* - A lengthy legal battle ensued when Terri Schiavo's husband requested her feeding tube be removed after she had been in a persistent vegetative state for 15 years. Despite her parents' opposition, the tube was removed and Schiavo died 13 days later, raising questions about the definition of life and the right to die.
