# Criticism and Controversies in Total Soccer

## Introduction

Total Soccer, the very embodiment of a unified and integrated approach to the game of soccer, has not been free from critique and controversy. With its inception dating back to the 1970s Ajax Amsterdam and Dutch national team, it's a strategy that has had its fair share of discussions, disagreements, and dissent. This article aims to dissect some key criticisms and controversies surrounding Total Soccer.

## Main Content

### Criticism

1. **Loss of Specialization**: Fundamental to Total Soccer is the belief that every player can play in every position. Critics argue that this might lead to the loss of specialized skills since players are no longer assigned to and trained in certain positions. The lack of position-specific expertise might disadvantage them when facing teams with highly specialized players.

2. **High Physical and Mental Demand**: Total Soccer demands a high level of both physical stamina and cognitive understanding of the game from its players. Critics say that this might disadvantage teams with fewer resources as they might not have the ability to ensure every player reaches the required level of physical and mental competence.

3. **Not Universally Applicable**: Critics note that Total Soccer might not work for every team. They argue that while it worked spectacularly for teams like Ajax and FC Barcelona, itâ€™s not a guarantee it would work for every team. The system heavily depends upon the skill level of the players, their understanding of the game, and the context of the team.

### Controversies

1. **Who Invented Total Soccer?**: One of the oldest controversies surrounding Total Soccer is about its origin. Many credit Rinus Michels, the former manager of Ajax and the Netherlands national team, as the father of Total Soccer, while others credit Jack Reynolds, his predecessor. Meanwhile, some argue that Viktor Maslov and his Dynamo Kyiv team in the 1960s used a similar approach.

2. **The Modern Usage**: There has been controversy over how the principles of Total Soccer are applied in modern soccer. Some purists argue that teams like FC Barcelona have strayed from the genuine ideals of Total Soccer, focusing more on retaining possession than the dynamic interchange of positions.

3. **The Name**: There is also debate over the name "Total Soccer." Many argue that the correct translation from Dutch ("Totaalvoetbal") should be "Total Football." This controversy, though minor, reflects the broader debates over the philosophy's origins and meanings.


## Conclusion

Despite its criticisms and controversies, there's no denial that Total Soccer has been profoundly influential, shaping many successful teams and inspiring lots of tactical philosophies. While its interpretations differ significantly and the debates over its applications continue, the core principles of the style remain intact: flexibility, possession, and teamwork.
