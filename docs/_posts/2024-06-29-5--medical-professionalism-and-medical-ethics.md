## Background
This section will establish the context of bioethics, with a focus on the development and application of medical professionalism and medical ethics.

Bioethics, a field of applied ethics, engages with the ethical, legal, social, and philosophical issues that arise in health care and the life sciences. Both medical professionalism and medical ethics fall within this sphere.

Medical professionalism refers to a set of values, behaviors, and relationships that underpin the trust the public has in doctors. Meanwhile, medical ethics involves making well-considered decisions about medical interventions, taking into account a patient's preferences, the best available evidence, and the balance of benefits and harms.

## Medical Professionalism
This section focuses on the concept of medical professionalism, its key principles, and importance in bioethical contexts.

Medical professionalism denotes the social contract between the medical community and society. This contract involves expectations and responsibilities, such as maintaining clinical competence, ensuring patient welfare, demonstrating accountability, and promoting public health. It also encapsulates the tradition of self-regulation among physicians.

## Medical Ethics
In this section, we delve into medical ethics, its guiding principles, and their application.

Medical ethics is the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to medicine. It employs principles like patient autonomy, beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice to guide decision-making in healthcare. Examples include end-of-life decision-making, confidentiality, and informed consent.

## Linking Medical Professionalism and Medical Ethics
This segment explores how medical professionalism and medical ethics intersect and influence each other in bioethical contexts.

Medical professionalism and medical ethics are interwoven in practicing medicine. Professionalism sets the expectations and standards for physicians, while ethics guides their decisions. As professionals, doctors are obliged to adhere to ethical guidelines. Conversely, ethical dilemmas often test medical professionalism.

## Examples and Use Cases
This section provides real-world examples showcasing the interplay of medical professionalism and medical ethics.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global example of this intersection. Physicians had to balance ethical principles such as beneficence and non-maleficence, while performing their professional duties by providing care under strained circumstances or allocating scarce resources fairly.

## Tools and Techniques 
This segment discusses tools that have been developed to foster adherence to medical professionalism and ethics.

Ethics committees in healthcare institutions play a crucial role in solving complex bioethical dilea. Tools such as the four-boxes method make ethical decision-making more systematic by considering medical indications, patient preferences, quality of life, and contextual features.
