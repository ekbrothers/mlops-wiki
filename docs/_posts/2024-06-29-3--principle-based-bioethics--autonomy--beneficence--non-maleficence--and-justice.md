# Principle-based Bioethics: Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, and Justice

Bioethics is a multidisciplinary field that addresses ethical issues related to biology and medicine. Principle-based bioethics is an approach in this field that focuses on four fundamental principles: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles are often used as a framework to guide ethical decision-making in a range of biomedical contexts.

## Autonomy

"Autonomy" in principle-based bioethics refers to the right of individuals to make decisions about their own health and life. This principle requires respect for patients' decisions and acknowledgment of their ability to self-govern. It's particularly relevant in informed consent situations, where healthcare practitioners must ensure their patients understand the implications of a medical treatment or procedure. 

An example of this principle being violated may occur when a patient is forced to undergo a medical procedure they do not consent to, infringing on their autonomy. 

## Beneficence

"Beneficence" refers to the principle of promoting well-being and doing good. In bioethics, this principle is often mapped to the concept of healthcare practitioners having a duty to benefit the patient and advance their health status. Beneficence guides the conduct of medical practitioners towards actions that are beneficial for the patient.

For example, a physician prescribing a treatment that carries some risks but is known to be highly effective in treating a patient's condition would be acting in accordance to the principle of beneficence. 

## Non-Maleficence

"Non-Maleficence" is a principle that translates to the oath of "do no harm". Medical professionals are obligated to ensure that the potential benefits of any medical action outweigh its potential harms. This principle is closely related to beneficence, however, where beneficence suggests that healthcare providers ought to act in ways that actively benefit patients, non-maleficence focuses on avoiding harm.

An example of non-maleficence is opting not to perform a risky procedure when a less risky, equally effective alternative is available.

## Justice

"Justice" in principle-based bioethics refers to equal distribution of benefits, rights, and responsibilities. It relates to the fairness and equality in healthcare context, ensuring every individual have equal access to medical facilities and therapies.

For instance, a public health policy that ensures access to affordable medications for individuals across different income levels is an application of this principle.
