# Tools and Technologies used in MLOps

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations or MLOps is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production Machine Learning (or ML) lifecycle. It seeks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. With the growing popularity and importance of Machine Learning models in businesses, effective management of these models in production has become instrumental. This article extensively covers various tools and technologies that are commonly used in MLOps.

## Main Content

### 1. Version Control Systems

**Git**: It is one of the most popular version control systems that track changes to source code during software development. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency, making it a preferred choice for ML projects.

**Mercurial**: A free, distributed source control management tool which handles large projects that are too huge for well-known systems like Git.

### 2. Data Version Control 

**DVC**: An open-source tool that is designed to handle data versioning. It’s built on top of Git and uses a similar command-line interface.

### 3. Workflow Orchestration Tools

**Airflow**: A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows, created by Airbnb. It allows you to schedule and monitor workflows and ensure they’ve succeeded or retry in case they haven’t.

**Kubeflow**: An open-source project dedicated to making deployments of Machine Learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes, simple, portable, and scalable.

### 4. Feature Store

**Feast**: It is an open-source tool that allows teams involved in machine learning to manage, store, discover, and serve machine learning features up to date.

### 5. Model Training

**PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**: Two open-source machine learning libraries for research and production providing maximum flexibility and speed.

### 6. Model Registry

**MLflow**: An open-source platform for managing the entire Machine Learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

### 7. Model Deployment

**Seldon**: An open-source platform for deploying machine learning models on Kubernetes.

**TFX (TensorFlow Extended)**: A Google-production-scale machine learning platform based on Tensorflow. It provides a configuration framework and shared libraries to integrate common components.

### 8. Model Monitoring

**EvidentlyAI**: An open-source python library to analyze and monitor Machine Learning models. 

**Grafana** and **Prometheus**: Open-source solutions to help you monitor and visualize metrics from your applications, infrastructure and third-party tools.

### 9. Infrastructure

**Docker** and **Kubernetes**: Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Conclusion

For successful MLOps implementation, it is essential to identify the right tools and technology at each stage of the Machine Learning lifecycle. These tools, as outlined above, cover every aspect of the MLOps pipeline though the selection highly depends on the business specifics, scale and regulatory requirements. As MLOps is still emerging, it is expected to see more dedicated tools and resources in future, making the ML lifecycle even more efficient and manageable.
