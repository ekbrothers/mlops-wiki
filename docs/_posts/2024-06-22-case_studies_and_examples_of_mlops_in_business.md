# Case Studies and Examples of MLOps in Business

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations, abbreviated as MLOps, is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage the production ML lifecycle. MLOps involves the development and deployment of machine learning models in a sustained, reliable, and scalable manner. This article aims to delve into some of the prominent case studies and examples where MLOps has been used in business. Major companies worldwide have incorporated MLOps practices into their models, proving its worth and effectiveness.

### 1. Google

Presently, Google is developing and refining an internal platform, continuously learning and deploying machine learning models on a large scale. Calling this initiative TFX (TensorFlow Extended), Google uses this platform to manage and enhance its ML lifecycle in various services, such as Gmail (for spam detection), YouTube (for recommendations), and many others. Essentially, by adopting MLOps using TFX, Google streamlines its ML model development, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and robust production.

### 2. Uber

Uber built an internal tool, Michelangelo, which is utterly ML-centric, to support rapidly growing business operations like dynamic pricing and food delivery estimations. With MLOps principles, Michelangelo provides a unified, coherent platform for all steps involved in the building and deploying ML models. It has improved efficiency and functionality in the Uber app in various aspects from surge pricing calculations to route optimization.

### 3. Netflix

Netflix uses Metaflow, an ML framework designed to simplify the process of building and managing real-life data science projects, implying MLOps principles. Netflix runs several experiments each day to analyze user behaviour and maintain the recommendation engine. The MLOps approach with Metaflow has facilitated Netflix in making quick and reliable updates to its models in production.

### 4. Airbnb

Airbnb has also adapted the MLOps approach to manage its ML lifecycle. They've designed Bighead, a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning platform, to streamline the machine learning process. It helps match guests with hosts, dynamic pricing model, and fraud detection. With MLOps, Airbnb can efficiently manage ML models development and deployment, improving productivity and response to the customer's needs.

### 5. LinkedIn

LinkedIn has developed a tool named Pro-ML, which is a productive engineering methodology focusing on automating model lifecycle management based on MLOps principles. The Pro-ML tool has helped LinkedIn to effectively manage the end-to-end production model lifecycle, decreasing LinkedInâ€™s load of model management and incorporating predictions in near real-time.

## Conclusion

As seen from the diverse examples, machine learning operations or MLOps plays an incredibly crucial role in helping businesses capitalize on their machine learning investments. It facilitates the efficient deployment, monitoring, and operationalization of ML models in production, and several tech giants have bet on MLOps for their businesses. As businesses increasingly become data-driven, the importance of MLOps will continue to rise. It's not just about creating the models but effectively and efficiently managing them which sets successful companies apart. MLOps offers agility in machine learning processes, which organizations of every kind can benefit from.
