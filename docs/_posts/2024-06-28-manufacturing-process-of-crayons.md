## Raw Materials
Crayon manufacturing requires two primary components: pigments and paraffin wax. The pigments provide the color, and the paraffin wax gives the crayon substance and form. Pigments typically come from various natural or chemically-produced sources, and their quality and specific ratio determine the final hue of the crayon. 

## The Manufacturing Process
The process of creating a crayon involves several distinct steps from mixing and melting to packaging.

### Step 1: Mixing and Melting
The first step in crayon production involves melting paraffin wax, often in a large vat or container. The melted wax is then mixed with the proper amount of colored pigments. The exact ratios depend on the desired color and shade of the resulting crayon. 

### Step 2: Molding
The next step is to pour the melted, colored wax into crayon-shaped molds. This molding process is often automated and can produce thousands of crayons per machine per hour. The molds are also designed to be easily separated from the crayon once it has hardened.

### Step 3: Cooling and Ejection
Once in the mold, the wax needs to cool and harden. This process takes varying lengths of time depending on the specific chemicals in the wax. Once hardened, an automated machine ejects the crayons from the molds.

### Step 4: Inspection and Packaging
The last stage in manufacturing is inspection and packaging. Workers or machines check each crayon for any imperfections. If the crayon passes, it gets sorted into the appropriate packages and prepared for shipping.

## The Machinery
Crayon manufacturing makes use of specialized machinery for each step. This equipment includes wax melters, mixing vats, automatic molding machines, cooling belts for the solidification process, crayon ejectors, and sorting and packaging machines.

## Environmental Impact
Crayon manufacturing has a relatively low environmental impact, as the primary ingredient, paraffin wax, is biodegradable, and the process itself requires low energy inputs. However, it's essential for manufacturers to ensure their sourcing of pigments and packaging materials is environmentally responsible.

## Health and Safety Considerations
Crayon manufacturers must adhere to stringent health and safety standards due to the end-users' primarily being children. This adherence includes the use of non-toxic pigments and the need for rigorous testing to ensure no contaminants are present.
