# Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering and Cloning

Genetic engineering and cloning are two advanced biochemical technologies that have the potential to greatly impact medicine, agriculture, and various other fields. However, they also come with various ethical issues that need to be carefully considered.

## Genetic Engineering
### Understanding Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the process of manipulating an organism's genome using biotechnology. It involves the direct manipulation of one or more genes within an organism, often for the purpose of introducing new traits or improving existing ones. Tools-like CRISPR-Cas9 have become fundamental in this field due to their ease of use and versatility.

### Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering
The ethical issues arising due to genetic engineering include its potential to introduce undesired mutations, leading to unforeseen side-effects. The idea of "playing God" by manipulating genomes is also a source of criticism, with opponents arguing that such practices disrupt natural order. 

There are also concerns related to bioterrorism, as this technology could be used to create harmful biological agents. Additionally, the issue of equitable access arises, as the benefits of these technologies may not be equally available to all individuals and could lead to increased inequalities.

## Cloning
### Understanding Cloning
Cloning refers to the process of creating genetically identical individuals or cells. This can occur naturally (as in the case of identical twins), or can be induced artificially. Technologies like somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) have been used to clone animals such as Dolly the Sheep.

### Ethical Issues in Cloning
Cloning presents several ethical issues. These include questions about identity and individualityâ€”if a clone shares their genetic makeup with another being, what does this mean for their identity? There are also concerns about exploitation and commodification, as clones could be created for the sake of organ harvesting or other utilitarian purposes.

Like genetic engineering, cloning also confronts us with the potential for mistakes and unforeseen consequences. Cloned individuals may have shorter life spans or be more prone to genetic diseases, presenting serious animal welfare concerns in the case of animal cloning. 

## Common Ethical Considerations
The ethical issues highlighted in the areas of genetic engineering and cloning intersect in several ways. Common ethical concerns include the respect for autonomy and consent, beneficence and non-maleficence, justice, and potential for abuse.

The uncertainty and risks associated with these technologies illustrate a need for stringent ethical protocols to ensure responsible use and mitigate any unintended consequences. Furthermore, discussions about these technologies should include diverse stakeholders, including scientists, ethicists, and the general public, to guarantee that diverse perspectives and concerns are taken into account.

## Further Reading

5. Rights of Genetically Engineered or Cloned Organisms

Resources for continued study include Bioethics.net, The Hastings Center, and the Kennedy Institute of Ethics. Various bioethics textbooks and peer-reviewed articles can provide varying perspectives on these topics as well.
