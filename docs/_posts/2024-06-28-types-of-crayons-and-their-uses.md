## Wax Crayons
Wax crayons are the most common type and likely the first that comes to mind when one thinks of crayons. They're made from paraffin wax and color pigment. Wax crayons are typically used for coloring books, basic drawing, and children’s arts and crafts.

Examples of wax crayons include the ones manufactured by Crayola, one of the most recognized and trusted names in the market. These crayons are known for their bright, vibrant colors and durability.

## Beeswax Crayons
Beeswax crayons are made of natural beeswax and provide a higher quality drawing experience than traditional wax crayons. They are often used for detailed drawing as they offer a wide range of color intensity.

Some popular beeswax crayon brands include Stockmar and Faber-Castell. They're highly valued for both their smooth texture and environmental friendliness.

## Oil Pastel Crayons
Oil pastel crayons, often confused with regular wax crayons, are made with pigment, wax, and oil. They provide a soft, buttery texture and are suitable for blending and mixing colors.

They are a favorite of artists who enjoy techniques such as sgraffito (where layers of colors are revealed by scratching off the top layers) and resist techniques (where the oil pastel resists being covered by other materials such as watercolors).

## Watercolor Crayons
Watercolor crayons are water-soluble, which means they can be mixed with water to create watercolor paint effects. They offer the control of a regular crayon with the added ability to blend and create watercolor washes. 

This type of crayon is useful for scrapbooking, card making, and other crafts where you want to add a unique touch. 

## Fabric Crayons
Fabric crayons are made to draw directly onto fabrics. The drawings become permanent once ironed, turning any fabric into a personalized canvas.

They are particularly popular for creating customized clothing and décor items. A popular brand is Tulip, known for their vivid and durable colors.

## Caran d'Ache Crayons
Caran d'Ache is a Swiss brand known for its high-quality art supplies. Their crayons, known as Neocolor, have both water-soluble and wax-based versions and are chosen by professional artists for their high pigment concentrations and brilliant colors.

These crayons offer extraordinary covering power and excellent lightfastness, making them a premium choice for artists.
