# Total Soccer Skills and Techniques

## Introduction

Total soccer is a methodology of the sport that heavily emphasizes on the fluid movement of players around the pitch, possession, and team unity. This concept of "total football" or "total soccer" was popularized by teams like Ajax Amsterdam and the Dutch national team in the 1970s. In the total soccer approach, understanding and mastering specific skills and techniques plays a pivotal role. The application of these skills in context of the game's situation is what elevates a team following this approach beyond their opponents.

### Ball Control

Ball control is the foundational technique in total soccer. This skill involves controlling the ball using all parts of the body (excluding the arms and hands), which improves receiving and trapping abilities, passing accuracy, and confidence in possession.

### Dribbling

Dribbling is essential as it allows players to navigate through opponents while keeping possession of the ball. Proficient dribblers can change direction quickly and keep the ball close to their feet, making it difficult for opponents to steal the ball.

### Passing

In a total soccer setup, passing is more than just a skill, it is a philosophy. The ability to retain possession and circulate the ball amongst all players is a key characteristic. Short, quick passes with sudden longer passing to change the point of attack is a common strategy.

### Shooting

Scoring goals is the ultimate objective of any football match, and thus, shooting skills are important. However, in total soccer, one does not confine this skill only to strikers. Any player should be capable of taking a shot at goal when in a suitable position.

### Tackling

Ball recovery when out of possession is just as important in total soccer. This is achieved through tackling without conceding fouls. Timing, control, and precision are important in tackling. 

### Positioning

Positioning is what makes total soccer 'totalâ€™. Any player could take up any position at any given time for the advantage of the team, which requires understanding of each position's requirement. 

### Fitness and Conditioning

As the fluid style of play requires great amounts of physical work, players must be in peak physical condition. Training in stamina, endurance, and agility drills, along with strength and conditioning, are crucial parts of a total soccer player's repertoire. 

## Conclusion

In summary, Total Soccer demands a lot from its players. Skills such as ball control, dribbling, and shooting are critical, but so are techniques like tackling and positioning. Players also need to be physically fit and highly conditioned given the demanding nature of the style of play. However, the most important aspect is the intellectual understanding of the game and adaptability, as it is what truly defines total soccer. By learning and mastering these skills and techniques, players will be able to play soccer more successfully and in a more holistic manner.
