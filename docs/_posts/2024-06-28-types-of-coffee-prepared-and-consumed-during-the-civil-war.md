## Introduction to Coffee in the Civil War

During the Civil War, coffee was more than just a morning stimulant. It was a much-needed source of warmth and comfort and served as an important tool for the soldiers to combat fatigue, enabling them to stay alert and focused during their duties.

## Green Coffee Beans

Green, or unroasted, coffee beans were commonly supplied to Civil War soldiers. These beans were hard and had a long shelf life, making them ideal for the rough conditions of war. Soldiers would roast their own coffee beans over fires, then crush them with the butts of their rifles or any hard object they had available before brewing.

## Coffee Substitutes

During the Civil War, blockades resulted in the scarcity of coffee, especially in the southern part of the United States. As a result, many soldiers and civilians resorted to making coffee substitutes from a variety of ingredients such as roasted sweet potatoes, corn, peas, and various kinds of grain. This led to the creation of unique preparations like chicory coffee, which were attempts to recreate the taste of real coffee.

## Preparation Methods

The most common method of brewing coffee during the Civil War was boiling. Soldiers would bring water to a boil in tin cups or pots, add the crushed coffee beans, and continue to boil until the coffee reached the desired strength. However, it was a crude method and often led to a coffee filled with grounds.

## The Coffee Trade during the Civil War

Coffee beans were an important commodity during the Civil War. The North had an advantage due to their control over the ports and their stronger relationships with coffee-producing countries. The South, on the other hand, faced severe coffee shortages due to the blockades, affecting morale and the physical condition of the soldiers.
