# Use Cases and Real-ulations of MLOps

## Introduction

MLOps, also known as DevOps for Machine Learning, is an engineering culture and practice that unifies the development (Dev) and operations (Ops) aspects of Machine Learning algorithm development and deployment. As machine learning models are being adopted more widely, it becomes essential to ensure that these models are reliable, scalable, and robust.

MLOps entails a cross-functional team working across the machine learning application's lifecycle starting from model development, deployment, monitoring, and refining. The primary focus is to accelerate the deployment of machine learning models and to ensure accuracy and reliability of these deployed models.

In an era where data is the new oil and AI is the engine, Machine Learning Operations offers the pathway to successful, scalable and reliable AI model deployment. It has found widespread acceptance and applications across different domains and industries. Understanding the real-world implications and applications can provide a holistic understanding of the importance and impact of MLOps.
