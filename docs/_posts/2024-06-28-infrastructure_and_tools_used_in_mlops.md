# Infrastructure and Tools Used in MLOps

## Introduction

MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a practice that aims to facilitate the collaboration between data scientists and operations or production teams, very similar to the DevOps philosophy. To minimize dilemmas related to the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models, MLOps leverages a variety of tools, platforms, and infrastructure. This article provides an overview of some of these elements and the reasons they are crucial for operationalizing machine learning workflows.

## Main Content

### MLOps Stages and Relevant Tools

The MLOps cycle can be divided broadly into three stages, each of which requires a certain set of tools:

1. __Model Development__: Involves tasks like data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and evaluation. Tools used here often include python libraries like NumPy, SciKit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

2. __Model Deployment__: It involves transforming trained models into prediction services that can integrate with other systems. Tools used in this stage are generally model server frameworks like TensorFlow Serving, MLflow, Seldon, Azure ML, or even Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration of containers.

3. __Model Monitoring & Management__: This stage needs continuous monitoring of model performance to ensure that it is providing valuable predictions over time. Tools for this aspect include Grafana for visualizing metrics, Prometheus for monitoring, and Elasticsearch for storing monitoring data.

### Key Infrastructure Components 

There are several infrastructure components that are at the core of MLOps:

1. __Data orchestration and pipeline tools__: Tools like Apache Beam, Apache Airflow, and Kubeflow Pipelines help to automate and streamline the data processing workflows.

2. __Machine Learning Platforms__: Platforms like Google’s TensorFlow Extended (TFX), Uber’s Michelangelo, Facebook’s FBLearner, Netflix’s Metaflow, and Databricks simplify the machine learning lifecycle, from research and experimentation to deployment and management.

3. __Model Registry__: Organizations use model registries like MLflow’s Model Registry, or Sagemaker Model Registry to manage and keep track of their models.

4. __Cloud technology__: Services such as Google Cloud AI Platform, Amazon SageMaker, and Microsoft Azure are essential for scaling large ML workloads and enable teams to access compute and storage resources quickly.

### Popular Tools

Some tools are widely popular in the MLOps ecosystem:

1. __TensorFlow Extended (TFX)__: An end-to-end platform designed for deploying production ML pipelines while ensuring consistency and standardization.

2. __Kubeflow__: An open-source machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes which provides tools for composing, deploying, and managing scalable machine learning workflows.

3. __MLflow__: It supports the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

4. __SageMaker__: Amazon's fully managed service that enables developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

## Conclusion

Fundamentally, MLOps aims to automate as much of the machine learning lifecycle as possible, effectively treating ML models like software. The tools and infrastructure supporting MLOps are essential for the adept management of machine learning projects, allowing for collaborative development, swift deployment and efficient monitoring, and management of models. As the MLOps field continues to develop, maturing practices will lead to even more effective tools that streamline ML model lifecycle management within the complex, rapidly-evolving world of data science.
