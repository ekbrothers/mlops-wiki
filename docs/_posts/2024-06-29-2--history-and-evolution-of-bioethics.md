# History and Evolution of Bioethics

Bioethics is a branch of applied ethics that studies the philosophical, social, and legal issues arising in medicine and the life sciences. The history and evolution of bioethics encompasses the roots of its moral and philosophical questions as well as the timeline of its emergence as a formal field of study.

## Early Roots

In truth, various ethical issues and dilemmas in medicine have been considered since the time of ancient civilizations such as Greece, Rome, India, and China. For instance, the Hippocratic Oath, attributed to the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE, encapsulates some of the earliest ethical codes guiding physician's conduct, including the commitment to treat patients to the best of one's abilities and to respect patient privacy.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment brought significant focus on human rights, human dignity, autonomy, and the call for an end to cruel treatments. These philosophies influenced medical ethics discourses subsequently.

## Birth of Bioethics

The term "bioethics" was first introduced by the oncologist and biochemist Van Rensselaer Potter in 1970, who proposed it as a new discipline that would combine biology and humanistic knowledge to tackle human survival's challenges. Simultaneously, during the 1960s and '70s in the United States and Europe, a number of notorious medical experiments (e.g., the Tuskegee Syphilis Study) led to increased public awareness and demand for ethical regulations in medical and scientific research. This era also saw the development of various hormonal contraceptives and life-sustaining technologies, which further spurred ethical debates.

In 1974, the U.S. National Research Act was passed, leading to the formation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This commission played a crucial role in establishing codified, ethical guidelines for research, including the Belmont Report in 1979, which set forth basic ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects.

## Development and Expansion of Bioethics

During the 1980s and '90s, bioethics expanded beyond medical ethics and began to encompass issues related to environment and ecosystems, considering the broader impact of human activities and advancing technologies. Questions about the ethics of genetic engineering, cloning, assisted reproductive technologies, end-of-life care, healthcare resource allocation, and organ transplantation came to the forefront.

Organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNESCO, and the European Commission established bioethics committees to issue guidelines on these emerging issues. Meanwhile, numerous academic institutions began offering specialized programs in bioethics, equipping a new generation with tools to dissect and address multifaceted bioethical dilemmas.

## Bioethics in the 21st Century

In the 21st century, bioethics continues to evolve, now focusing on issues such as synthetic biology, genetic testing and editing, AI in health care, neuroethics, nanotechnology, enhancement medicine, and futuristic concepts such as transhumanism and post-humanism.

The complexity and global nature of these issues have led to an emphasis on global bioethics, bioethics diplomacy, and the development of universal ethical guidelines like the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.
